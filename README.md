Atari MULE game for CS 2340

Your task in M.U.L.E. or Multiple Use Labor Elements, is to colonize the planet IRATA (Atari spelled backwards) by maximizing your possession of land, goods, and money through the use of the resource collecting M.U.L.E.s. M.U.L.E. is to early home computer games as Monopoly is to classic boardgames. It's an incredibly nuanced, complicated game with a very primitive interface.
